# CheckList
a program that can create, load, write and read from txt files in order to create checklists
## Key things to note
The program will give some instructions using the console line so look at that, the inputs to the file are through the console and the file is initially null so you must either create the file or load a file before trying to open it or write to it or read from it or it will crash.
